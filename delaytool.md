DelayTool is a simple BPM calculator for producers, engineers, and musicians. Enter or tap the tempo and watch the table of values update automagically. For each common musical subdivision, you will see times (in milliseconds and Hertz) for the current tempo. Just what you need to precisely set up delays and oscillators!
